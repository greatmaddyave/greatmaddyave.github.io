                    <p>It's never easy to do something new, at least not when you've been doing 'mundane' for the past six or so years; is it time to do something insane? Should I take the leap to learn something completely new this late in the game, (I'm nearly 30 btw) or is it a chance to rediscover what I'm capable of?</p>

                    <p>Let me back up for a minute. My name is John and I'm starting this blog nearly 4 months into my Web Development career, or at the very least what i hope is my Web Development career. Why four months in? Well to be frank, I didn't even know how to write a web page 4 months ago. I came from zero code experience. I know, right? Insane. Why, you ask again? (Geez you are a curious one.) Well I lost my job. Yep, I got laid off...after 6 years with the company. This devestated me to say the least. I just became a father 3 months prior, just purchased a new car and was looking at purchasing my first home. So what now? </p>

                    <p>Well it was time to find another job right? Hopefully one that wasn't 2 hours away from me since I had a baby girl at home that I intended on spending every second I could. So I dusted off my resume and hit the job market with tenacity and to my amazment landed a job working in a similar field. (Real Estate). I was doing the analytical side before but I knew how the system worked. This time I was a Loan Officer but I <strong>hated</strong> it. I hated the people, I hated the atmosphere, I hated it all. Then, just like that i was laid off. I relized that I needed to work for someone or some company that gave me meaning, that used my brain, that wasn't an office full of post mediposal women that we're clearly not morning people. I wanted to work for a <em>.com</em> again.</p>

                    <p>I'd always see the developers whenever I'd go to the breakroom or on my way to the bathroom, they looked like a different company, they had fun stuff on the walls, got to work with big shiny iMacs that made my clunky windows computer look like your last choice for prom date. I envied every part of what they had. They didn't have to be quiet, they didn't have to wear <em>business casual</em> to the office. I wanted that, but I had a good job, actually a great job, and learning to code is so hard I'd never grasp something that difficult this late in my life. That time was over. This was my mentality, before I got laid off and then laid off again. Something was telling me that this was not the field for me. </p>

                    <p>I was defeated. The white flag was wavy, the towel had been thrown in.</p>

                    <p>Then, I had a thought. I had always been interested in technology and computers, and I had always wanted to learn to code, even bought a book or two, but I never had the time to commit to such an eguasting ciriculum. </p>

                    <blockquote> I think everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.  -Steve Jobs</blockquote>

                    <p>It was a risk but I cashed in my 401k filed for unemployment and set the goal of being a full stack web developer in 4 months.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">writing my first line of code.</h2>

                    <p>It's hard to believe how far I've come in just 2 1/2 months but this was my first line of coding. It doesn't look like much but it was enough to egnite the spark in me to find my love for coding.</p>
