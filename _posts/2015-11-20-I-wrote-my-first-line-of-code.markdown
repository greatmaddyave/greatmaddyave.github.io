It's never easy to do something new, at least not when you've been doing 'mundane' for the past six or so years; is it time to do something insane? Should I take the leap to learn something completely new this late in the game, (I'm nearly 30 btw) or is it a chance to rediscover what I'm capable of?

Let me back up for a minute. My name is John and I'm starting this blog nearly 4 months into my Web Development career, or at the very least what i hope is my Web Development career. Why four months in? Well to be frank, I didn't even know how to write a web page 4 months ago. I came from zero code experience. I know, right? Insane. Why, you ask again? (Geez you are a curious one.) Well I lost my job. Yep, I got laid off...after 6 years with the company. This devastated me to say the least. I just became a father 3 months prior, just purchased a new car and was looking at purchasing my first home. So what now?

Well it was time to find another job right? Hopefully one that wasn't 2 hours away from me since I had a baby girl at home that I intended on spending every second I could. So I dusted off my resume and hit the job market with tenacity and to my amazement landed a job working in a similar field. (Real Estate). I was doing the analytical side before but I knew how the system worked. This time I was a Loan Officer but I <strong>hated</strong> it. I hated the people, I hated the atmosphere, I hated it all. Then, just like that i was laid off. I realized that I needed to work for someone or some company that gave me meaning, that used my brain, that wasn't an office full of postmenopausal women that we're clearly not morning people. I wanted to work for a <em>.com</em> again.

I'd always see the developers whenever I'd go to the break room or on my way to the bathroom, they looked like a different company, they had fun stuff on the walls, got to work with big shiny iMacs that made my clunky windows computer look like your last choice for prom date. I envied every part of what they had. They didn't have to be quiet, they didn't have to wear <em>business casual</em> to the office. I wanted that, but I had a good job, actually a great job, and learning to code is so hard I'd never grasp something that difficult this late in my life. That time was over. This was my mentality, before I got laid off and then laid off again. Something was telling me that this was not the field for me.

<h2>So I'm unemployed, what now?</h2>

I was defeated. The white flag was waving, the towel had been thrown in.

Then, I had a thought. I had always been interested in technology and computers, and I had always wanted to learn to code, even bought a book or two, but I never had the time to commit to such an exhausting curriculum.

It was a risk but I cashed in my 401k filed for unemployment and set the goal of being a full stack web developer in 4 months.

<h2>Writing my first line of code.</h2>

It's hard to believe how far I've come in just 2 1/2 months but this was my first line of coding. It doesn't look like much but it was enough to ignite the spark in me to find my love for coding.
