caption: A jqueryUI or Bootstrap slider can add, not only some style to your webpage but also give it a level of professionalism. Although generally used to showcase an array of images, a slider can also save vertical space on your website for the many levels of an application that the user may not even interact with otherwise. It really leans up the look of your website and is one of my favorite utilizations of the slider that I don't see a lot of developers using.

<h1>What is an HTML framing Tool?</h1>
<br>
<p>An HTML framing Tool is a web developer tool that automatically structures your HTML based on a few clicks for when you are starting a new page. The point of an HTML framing tool is to cut down on initial start time when coding a new webpage as well as to make sure all your links and scripts to CDN's and libraries are valid and in the correct loading order</p>

<p>Today I woke up and had the idea for this web application and decided what the heck! Check it out, give it a go, let me know what you think!</p>
<br>
<a href="templ8/index.html"><button>Visit Templ8</button></a>

<style>
  button {
    padding: 15px 40px;
    width: 200px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
    transition: all ease-in-out 300ms;
    position: relative;
    margin-left: 50%;
    right: 100px;

  }

  button:hover {
    background-color: darkorange;
  }
</style>
