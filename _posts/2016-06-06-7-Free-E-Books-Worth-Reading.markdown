<div><br></div>
<h4>This is a free e-book by usability consultancy firm Userfocus. The best part of this book is its casual tone. Acronyms like "the CRAP way to usability" and The Beatles analogies make remembering the book’s lessons a lot easier, and makes for an interesting read. That’s why this book is one of my favorites.<h4>

  <div><br></div>
  <li>Interaction Design Best Practices Volume 2 covers the "intangibles" — time, responsiveness, and behavior — and covers topics from animation to enjoyment.</li>
  <div><br></div>
  <li>Consistency in UI Design explains the role that consistency plays in learnability, reducing friction, and drawing<br> attention to certain elements.</li>
</ul>
Altogether, the bundle includes 250 pages of best practices and 60 design examples.<br>
