Anyways thought I would just share that tid-bit with you as you may see some upcoming posts that talk about Jekyll. If you're lucky I may even do a tutorial or two. As for now I'm still figuring it out, but so far it's a blast!

<h2>Hi Folks!</h2>

You guessed it! This site is running Jekyll. Yes, that also means I'm running off of githubs very own servers...which I happen to think is pretty cool! Anyways thought I would just share that tid-bit with you as you may see some upcoming posts that talk about Jekyll. If you're lucky I may even do a tutorial or two. As for now I'm still figuring it out, but so far it's a blast!

<h3>Below you'll find what greats you as your first post in Jekyll:</h3>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
<div><br></div>

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
